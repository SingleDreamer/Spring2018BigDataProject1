## How to Run

1) Make sure you are using python2.7 to run this program. 

2) Run MongoDB (mongod) and Redis (redis-server)

If necessary, download the following:

MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

Redis: http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz

If you unzip these in the same folder as adkbase.py, there is an option to let the programs start the servers and store the databases in data/

3) Optional: create and activate the virtualenv in the folder. 

$ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 ENV
$ source ENV/bin/activate

4) Make sure you have all the dependecies (see below). If you are using a virtualenv, download the dependencies:

$ pip install pymongo redis numpy

5) Make sure the source files are in the /raw_data folder: 
entrez_ids_genesymbol.csv
entrez_ids_uniprot.txt
patients.csv
PPI.csv
ROSMAP_RNASeq_entrez.csv

6) Run the main program

$ python adkbase.py

7) Enter 'r' to reset the databases

$ > r

Please be aware this will take some time. 

## How to Use

Commands: 

1: Given a gene, find all of its n-order interacting genes

2: Given a gene, find mean and std of gene expression values for AD/MCI/NCI, respectively. (Takes slightly more time)

3: Given a gene, find all other information associated with this gene.

4: Given a patient id, find all patient information (age, gender, education etc.)

If no data is showing or databases have not been set up: 

r: reset databases

   rs: reset sql only

   rm: reset mongodb only

   rr: reset redis only 

h: list commands

e: exit


## dependencies (use virtualenv)
This requires Python2.7
- sqlite3
- numpy
- pymongo
- redis

## notes
- django?? not set up yet
- needs stress testing  
- need to use mapreduce in the mongo large csv part c2 part too work on that
